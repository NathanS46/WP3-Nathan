          Before The 11 treaties the hudsons bay company owned all of the land
          from 1670-1870. They got this land from finding it and claiming it
          even though the indigious peoples of canada where already living
          there. The hudsons bay company tried to ignore the indigious peoples
          but in 1870 when the hudsons bay company sold the land to the
          government of canada the indiginous peoples where still on the land
          and didnt want to be ignored so when the government of canada took
          over they didnt want to be confined anymore and started to make
          treatys with the government of canada.
